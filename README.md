# Food-guru

Hi there

We are Team Food Waste Warriors, and we are presenting our hack for the Accessibility Theme. 

Our app will help many of our users with and without vulnerabilities to manage their food stock at home, as well as 
make suggestions and nudges to help the user make great choices in relation to saving money, sustainability and 
maintining their health by not consuming spoiled food. 

We have included 3 Personas and Scenarios when designing our app, to help us put the user at the centre of our 
solution.

Our app will benegfit people who are visually impaired as the app can be used to read important nutritional information
about the food they consume - the writing is really really small!- or can alert people who have memory issues to throw out
expired food or take action to maintain their blood sugar levels. 

We have included a PDF version of our Prezzi presenation, but you will get the best experience by viewing the interactive 
presentation through this link: https://prezi.com/view/ZxanBSr0OmVyplMJRGxq/
